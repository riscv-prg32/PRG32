## 🚀 Quick Start (macOS)

```bash
# 1) Dependencies
brew install git cmake ninja dfu-util ccache libusb python

# 2) ESP-IDF
cd $HOME
git clone -b v5.3 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c3,esp32c6
. ./export.sh

# 3) Project
cd /path/to/PRG32

# 4) Build and flash physical ESP32-C6 firmware
idf.py -B build-esp32c6 -D SDKCONFIG=build-esp32c6/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults set-target esp32c6
idf.py -B build-esp32c6 -D SDKCONFIG=build-esp32c6/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults flash monitor

# 5) Build QEMU firmware
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG=build-qemu/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu set-target esp32c3
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG=build-qemu/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu build

# 6) Run QEMU once (creates build-qemu/qemu_flash.bin)
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG=build-qemu/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu qemu --graphics monitor
```

Open a second terminal (source ESP-IDF again), then stage a demo cartridge:

```bash
cd /path/to/PRG32
. $HOME/esp-idf/export.sh
python3 tools/prg32_game.py build \
  examples/games/asteroids/graphics/game.S \
  --firmware-elf build-qemu/PRG32.elf \
  --entry-prefix asteroids_graphics \
  --name asteroids \
  --out build-qemu/asteroids.prg32
python3 tools/prg32_game.py upload-qemu build-qemu/asteroids.prg32 --flash build-qemu/qemu_flash.bin
```

Run everything with one command next time:

```bash
./scripts/run_qemu_demo.sh
```

## 🍏 macOS Setup (Tested on Apple Silicon)

```bash
brew install git cmake ninja dfu-util ccache libusb python
cd $HOME
git clone -b v5.3 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c3,esp32c6
. ./export.sh
```

Quality-of-life alias:

```bash
alias get_idf=". $HOME/esp-idf/export.sh"
```

Common pitfalls:

- New shell opened: run `get_idf` again.
- `idf.py` missing: ESP-IDF not sourced.
- `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc` missing: ESP-IDF toolchain not installed/sourced.

## PlatformIO Quick Start

Open the repository root in PlatformIO. The checked-in `platformio.ini` default
environment is `prg32-esp32c6`, which targets the ESP32-C6 DevKitC-1 with
ESP-IDF, reuses the standard `main` component, and applies
`partitions_prg32.csv` plus `sdkconfig.defaults`.

CLI equivalents:

```bash
pio run
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

The ESP32-C6 build keeps UART0 as the primary ESP-IDF console and enables
native USB Serial/JTAG as secondary output for PlatformIO Monitor. A healthy
boot logs the configured `prg32_lcd` ILI9341 pins before drawing the splash.

The PlatformIO environment is for the physical ESP32-C6 classroom board. Keep
using the `idf.py` commands in `docs/qemu.md` for QEMU screen builds.

## 🧠 How PRG32 works

- PRG32 is **not** a CPU instruction emulator.
- Code runs natively on ESP32-C6 hardware, or on Espressif QEMU firmware target
  ESP32-C3 for desktop graphics/testing.
- Games are distributed as cartridges (`.prg32`) loaded by the runtime.
- Input supports one or two digital joystick modules through the same PRG32
  bitmask used by QEMU and cartridge tests.
- Hold A + B + DOWN on either joystick to restart the PRG32 firmware.
- Audio supports mandatory mono I2S output and optional stereo PRG32 Audio Plus
  using MAX98357A amplifier breakouts.

Flow:

```text
.S source -> riscv toolchain -> .prg32 cartridge -> PRG32 runtime -> init/update/draw loop
```

## ❗ Troubleshooting

- `idf.py: command not found`: ESP-IDF is not sourced. Run
  `. $HOME/esp-idf/export.sh`.
- Black display on real ESP32-C6 hardware: rebuild with the physical build
  directory, not the QEMU one:
  `idf.py -B build-esp32c6 -D SDKCONFIG=build-esp32c6/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults set-target esp32c6`
  then
  `idf.py -B build-esp32c6 -D SDKCONFIG=build-esp32c6/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults flash monitor`.
  The monitor should log `prg32_lcd` with the configured ILI9341 pins.
- PlatformIO Monitor shows only ROM boot text or only its header: the firmware
  was probably built with an older generated `sdkconfig.prg32-esp32c6`, or the
  USB monitor missed secondary-console output during reset. Delete that
  generated file once, rebuild, upload, open Monitor again, and press RESET/EN
  on the board. A healthy app boot logs `PRG32 boot: app_main entered` and the
  configured `prg32_lcd` pins.
- PlatformIO says it cannot exclusively lock `/dev/cu.usbmodem...`: close every
  other Serial Monitor, ESP-IDF Monitor, Arduino Serial Monitor, and terminal
  using that port, then start only one PlatformIO Monitor.
- QEMU runs but the game does not move: QEMU defaults disable physical GPIO
  buttons. Use a UART bridge packet source, or debug logic with the overlay/GDB.
- Cartridge upload fails: `build-qemu/qemu_flash.bin` is missing/invalid, or the
  cartridge is too large. Run QEMU once, then rerun `upload-qemu`.
- `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc` missing: re-run `./install.sh esp32c3,esp32c6` and
  source the ESP-IDF export script.
- Partition mismatch errors: run `tools/prg32_game.py doctor` and verify
  `partitions_prg32.csv` plus the selected cartridge slot.

## Learning Path

1. Build and flash the resident firmware.
2. Open setup with A+B at boot, run the device demo, and upload a cartridge.
3. Read `docs/tutorial.md` for assembly or `docs/tutorial_c_game.md` for C.
4. Complete the labs in `docs/labs`.
5. Modify one example game under `examples/games`.
6. Try a focused rendering demo under `examples/features`.
7. Package it as a `.prg32` cartridge and upload it over Wi-Fi or stage it into
   the QEMU flash image.

The intended student rhythm is small and visible: change one thing, run it,
observe the result, and write down what changed.

## Feature Demos

The `examples/features` directory contains focused demos for framework features:

- scrolling and parallax playfields
- animated sprites
- dual playfield rendering
- full-screen firmware splash and 320x200 game title splash screens
- upper/lower status bands for FPS, Wi-Fi, game info, and debug text
- joystick-driven on-screen keyboard input with printable ASCII support
- Wi-Fi setup mode
- setup audio menu with output detection, volume, and test tune
- configurable onboard RGB LED API and optional audio VU meter
- audio synthesis and sample playback
- player 2 input

Use these before building a full game when the lesson is about one graphics
technique rather than game rules.

## Audio

PRG32 supports retro-style digital audio through I2S.

The default configuration uses one MAX98357A I2S DAC/amplifier breakout for
mono output. Optional stereo output, called PRG32 Audio Plus, uses two
MAX98357A breakouts on the same I2S bus: one configured for the left channel
and one configured for the right channel.

Start with:

- `examples/audio_mono_beep`
- `examples/audio_mono_sample`
- `examples/audio_mono_tracker`
- `examples/audio_stereo_pan_test`
- `examples/audio_stereo_music`

See [docs/audio.md](docs/audio.md) for wiring, API, cartridge AUDIO blocks, and
troubleshooting.

The resident firmware also shows a full 320x240 logo splash screen on boot.
Physical ESP32-C6 builds enter setup when A+B are held during boot, when no
cartridge is stored, or when multiple cartridges exist without a default. The
setup menu can run a cartridge, set the default boot cartridge, configure Wi-Fi,
open the audio setup menu, open the developer status-band menu, show the about
screen, or launch the device demo. Setup screens show the active Wi-Fi mode and current IP address,
and either joystick can navigate them with SELECT/B to confirm and A to go
back. The device demo includes 320x200 sketches inspired by Pong, Breakout,
Space Invaders, Pacman, Tetris, Pole Position, Asteroids, a side-scrolling
platform game, a Doom-style raycaster, and a space cockpit that demonstrates
dual playfields. When the audio configuration is usable for the current board,
the splash plays a short welcome sound; otherwise it falls back to the passive
buzzer when configured.

## Example Games

The `examples/games` directory includes ASCII assembly, graphics assembly, and
C versions of:

- `pong`
- `breakout`
- `space_invaders`
- `pacman`
- `asteroids`
- `tetris`
- `platformer`
- `raycaster`
- `wing_commander`

See [examples/games/README.md](examples/games/README.md) for step-by-step
instructions to run each game embedded in firmware or as an uploadable
cartridge on hardware and QEMU.

## Teaching Tracks

PRG32 supports two classroom tracks over the same runtime:

- Computing Architecture: RISC-V assembly examples under `examples/games/*/ascii`
  and `examples/games/*/graphics`.
- C Programming: C examples under `examples/games/*/c` and
  `examples/features/*/c`.

See [docs/teaching_with_prg32.md](docs/teaching_with_prg32.md) for trainer notes,
lab sequencing, and how to compare assembly and C versions of the same example.
The C programming tutorial is [docs/tutorial_c_game.md](docs/tutorial_c_game.md).

## Runtime APIs

- Runtime/diagnostics: `GET /api/runtime`
- Games: `GET /api/games`, `POST /api/games?slot=cart0`, `POST /api/games/select?slot=cart0`
- Optional scores: `GET /api/scores`, `POST /api/scores`

`/api/runtime` includes firmware version, cartridge state, frame count, and last input state.

## Asset Tools

- `tools/prg32_image_convert.py`: convert PNG/JPEG/GIF assets to C or assembly.
- `tools/prg32_image_prepare.py`: interactive terminal preparation helper.
- `tools/prg32_audio_convert.py`: convert WAV samples or MIDI tracks.
- `tools/wav2prg32sample.py`: convert WAV to unsigned 8-bit PRG32 sample data.
- `tools/midi2prg32audio.py`: convert simple MIDI notes to tracker JSON.
- `tools/prg32audio_pack.py`: pack samples, instruments, and tracks into an
  AUDIO block for `.prg32` cartridges.

See [docs/assets.md](docs/assets.md).

## Developer Tools

- Doctor check:

```bash
python3 tools/prg32_game.py doctor
```

- One-shot QEMU demo:

```bash
./scripts/run_qemu_demo.sh
```

## 🧪 Smoke Test

This script verifies the basic PRG32 workflow end to end: environment setup,
firmware build, cartridge build, and QEMU staging.

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

Expected result:

- all steps print `[OK]`
- warnings may appear but are non-blocking
- final output shows `=== SMOKE TEST PASSED ===`

For GitHub Actions and machines without ESP-IDF, the repository also provides a
host-only smoke test:

```bash
bash scripts/ci_smoke_test.sh
```

That check runs Python syntax checks, unit tests, whitespace validation, and the
cartridge tool doctor in host-only mode.
