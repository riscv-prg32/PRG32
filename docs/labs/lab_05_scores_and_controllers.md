# Lab 05 - Scores and External Controllers

## Goal

Use the score API and the UART controller bridge.

## Steps

1. Run the local server:

```bash
python3 tools/prg32_score_server/app.py
```

2. Test it from a terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scores \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"game":"pong","player":"Ada","score":42}'
```

3. Enable Wi-Fi scores in `main/prg32_config.h` if using board networking.
4. Submit a local score with `prg32_score_submit`.
5. Connect a bridge board or serial helper that sends:

```text
'U' 'G' <lo> <hi>
```

6. Verify that `prg32_input_read` sees both local buttons and bridge input.
7. Query the cartridge runtime:

```bash
curl http://192.168.4.1/api/runtime
```

8. Build and upload one `.prg32` cartridge with `tools/prg32_game.py`.

## Checkpoint

Show one score in `/api/scores`, one controller movement through the bridge, and
at least one uploaded cartridge slot listed by `/api/games`.

Use the physical board for bridge wiring. QEMU can still run the score server
portion and can be extended later with a host-side UART packet sender.

## Reflection

What part of the system translates a real USB controller into the simple PRG32 bitmask?
