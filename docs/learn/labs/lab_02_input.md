# Lab 02 - Input Bitmasks

## Goal

Read buttons as a single integer and test bits with RISC-V instructions.

## Steps

1. Open `components/prg32/include/prg32.h`.
2. Find the `PRG32_BTN_*` bit definitions.
3. In an assembly update routine, call:

```asm
call prg32_input_read
mv t0, a0
andi t1, t0, 1
```

4. If `t1` is not zero, move an object left.
5. Repeat for right, up, and down.
6. Print the raw input mask with `prg32_console_hex32`.

## Checkpoint

The object must move only while the matching button is pressed.

This checkpoint works in QEMU with the monitor terminal keyboard mapper:
arrow keys or `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` drive joystick 1, `Enter`/`Space` is SELECT,
`J`/`Z` is A, and `K`/`X` is B. Repeat the same check on the physical board
when validating the GPIO wiring.

## Debug Question

Why is `andi` enough for `PRG32_BTN_LEFT` but not enough for every possible bitmask test?
