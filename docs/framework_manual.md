# PRG32 Framework Manual

PRG32 lets students write game logic in RISC-V assembly or C while a small
framework provides hardware access.

## Assembly ABI

Arguments use the standard RISC-V calling convention: `a0` to `a7` carry
arguments and return values, `ra` holds the return address, and `sp` is kept
16-byte aligned around C calls.

## Console modes

- `PRG32_MODE_UART_ONLY`: serial terminal only.
- `PRG32_MODE_LCD_ONLY`: text appears on the ILI9341 display.
- `PRG32_MODE_UART_LCD_MIRROR`: debug text is sent both to serial and LCD.

## Input and Player 2

`prg32_input_read()` returns the full PRG32 input register. Player 1 uses the
low bits:

- `PRG32_BTN_LEFT`
- `PRG32_BTN_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_BTN_UP`
- `PRG32_BTN_DOWN`
- `PRG32_BTN_A`
- `PRG32_BTN_B`
- `PRG32_BTN_START`

Player 2 uses the same layout shifted into the `PRG32_P2_*` bits. Games can use
`prg32_input_read_player(1)` or `prg32_input_read_player(2)` to get a normalized
low-bit mask for each player. This keeps Pong-style two-player games readable
in both C and assembly.

QEMU and host-driven tests can inject the same bitmask through
`prg32_diag_set_input_state()`, so two-player logic can be tested without the
physical second joystick mounted.

## Joystick Text Input

The on-screen keyboard lets games and framework setup screens collect short
alphanumeric text without a USB keyboard.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_keyboard_init(keyboard, buffer, capacity)`
- `prg32_keyboard_update(keyboard, input_mask)`
- `prg32_keyboard_draw(keyboard, x, y)`
- `prg32_text_input(buffer, capacity, title)`

Controls:

- D-pad: move around the key grid.
- A: select key.
- B: delete.
- START: finish.

## Graphics model

The physical display is 320x240, but the game viewport is 320x200. The extra
vertical area is reserved for border, status, or debugging. The ILI9341 renderer
tracks dirty rectangles and sends only changed areas over SPI using ESP-IDF SPI
DMA.

The QEMU renderer exposes the same 320x200 PRG32 viewport through Espressif's
virtual RGB panel. Student assembly code does not change; only the selected
display backend changes.

For classroom debugging, optional helper `prg32_debug_overlay_draw` can print
`x`, `y`, input mask, frame, and tick info on the top scanline.

Display backend selection:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_ILI9341`: physical ILI9341 SPI TFT, default.
- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_QEMU_RGB`: QEMU virtual RGB framebuffer.

Use the QEMU defaults file when running on a desktop:

```bash
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu qemu --graphics monitor
```

When the QEMU backend is selected, `main/prg32_config.h` disables physical GPIO
buttons, the buzzer, and the UART controller bridge. This keeps desktop screen
tests focused on rendering and GDB exercises.

## Cartridge runtime

The resident firmware includes a cartridge loader so games can be replaced
without reflashing the whole ESP32-C6 app.

Important constants:

- `PRG32_CART_MAGIC`: `.prg32` package magic.
- `PRG32_CART_ABI_MAJOR` / `PRG32_CART_ABI_MINOR`: loader ABI version.
- `PRG32_CART_RAM_SIZE`: executable cartridge RAM window, currently 32 KiB.

Important functions:

- `prg32_cart_load_addr()`: runtime address used by the host linker.
- `prg32_cart_install(image, size, persist)`: validate, load, and optionally store.
- `prg32_cart_call_init()`
- `prg32_cart_call_update()`
- `prg32_cart_call_draw()`

The default app automatically calls the current cartridge every frame when one
is loaded.

## Wi-Fi Modes and Setup

PRG32 supports three Wi-Fi runtime modes:

- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_STA`: connect to an existing access point.
- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_AP`: create the PRG32 access point.
- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_APSTA`: keep the upload AP while also connecting as station.

The setup GPIO is `PRG32_PIN_SETUP`. Hold it low during boot to enter setup
mode. The setup screen lets the user choose access-point mode or station mode,
then uses the joystick keyboard for SSID and password input.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_wifi_setup_requested()`
- `prg32_wifi_setup_run()`
- `prg32_wifi_start_mode(config)`
- `prg32_wifi_current_mode()`

The chosen settings are stored in NVS under the `prg32wifi` namespace. QEMU
builds keep physical Wi-Fi disabled by default, but games can still compile
against the same API and exercise setup screens.

## Tile engine

The tile engine exposes a 40x25 grid of 8x8 tiles. This matches a 320x200 retro
screen exactly.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_tile_define(id, bitmap8x8, fg, bg)`: define a reusable tile.
- `prg32_tile_put(tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in the simple 40x25 tile map.
- `prg32_tile_present()`: draw dirty simple-map tiles and present the frame.

The simple tile map is best for first tile exercises. Use playfields when the
lesson needs scrolling, parallax, or two layers.

## Scrolling and Playfields

PRG32 includes two scrollable 64x32 tile playfields. A playfield is larger than
the visible 40x25 tile viewport, so it can scroll horizontally and vertically.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_playfield_clear(layer, tile_id)`: fill one playfield with a tile.
- `prg32_playfield_put(layer, tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in one playfield.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll(layer, x, y)`: set pixel scroll for one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll_by(layer, dx, dy)`: move one layer by a delta.
- `prg32_playfield_camera(x, y)`: set a shared camera position.
- `prg32_playfield_parallax(layer, x_q8, y_q8)`: set camera scale per layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw(layer, transparent_zero)`: draw one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`: draw layer 0 opaque and layer 1 transparent.

Parallax factors use Q8 fixed point:

```text
256 = 1.0x camera speed
128 = 0.5x camera speed
 64 = 0.25x camera speed
```

For a parallax background, set layer 0 to a smaller factor and layer 1 to
`PRG32_PARALLAX_1X`. The foreground layer treats tile `0` as transparent when
drawn through `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`.

## Platform Tile Engine

The platform helpers build on playfields by assigning behavior flags to tile
IDs and moving an actor rectangle through the flagged world.

Tile flags:

- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_SOLID`: blocks movement from every side.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_PLATFORM`: one-way floor, useful for ledges.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_HAZARD`: marks spikes, enemies, or damage tiles.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_COLLECT`: marks collectible tiles.

Actor state bits:

- `PRG32_PLATFORM_ON_GROUND`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_LEFT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_HEAD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HAZARD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_COLLECT`

Useful calls:

- `prg32_platform_tile_flags(tile_id, flags)`: define tile behavior.
- `prg32_platform_actor_init(actor, layer, x, y, w, h)`: create an actor.
- `prg32_platform_actor_step(actor, input, speed, jump, gravity, max_fall)`:
  apply left/right movement, jump, gravity, and tile collision.
- `prg32_platform_camera_follow(actor, deadzone_x, deadzone_y)`: follow an actor
  inside the playfield world.

The platform engine intentionally uses integer pixels and small rectangles so
students can inspect every value from C or RISC-V assembly.

Assembly labs can use the `PRG32_PLATFORM_ACTOR_*_OFFSET` macros or treat
`prg32_platform_actor_t` as a 24-byte record:

```text
0:x  4:y  8:vx  12:vy  16:w  18:h  20:state  22:layer
```

## Sprite engine

The sprite layer provides simple bitmap drawing and axis-aligned bounding-box
collision detection.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_sprite_draw_8x8(x, y, bits, fg, bg)`: draw a monochrome sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_16x16(x, y, rgb565)`: draw a 16x16 RGB565 sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_hitbox(...)`: test two axis-aligned rectangles.
- `prg32_sprite_anim_frame(now_ms, frame_count, frame_ms)`: compute a frame.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_frame(...)`: draw one frame from a sprite sheet.

`prg32_sprite_draw_frame` accepts width, height, a pointer to contiguous RGB565
frames, the frame index, and a transparent color. This keeps animated sprites
usable from assembly without requiring a C object.

## Audio

`prg32_audio_beep(hz, ms)` uses PWM to drive a passive buzzer.

Additional audio helpers:

- `prg32_audio_tone(hz, ms, duty)`: PWM tone with explicit duty cycle.
- `prg32_audio_note(midi_note, ms)`: MIDI-like note number to tone.
- `prg32_audio_play_notes(notes, count)`: blocking sequence of notes/rests.
- `prg32_audio_sample_u8(samples, count, rate)`: play unsigned 8-bit samples
  through PWM.

The sample player is intentionally simple and classroom-visible. It is useful
for short effects, not high-fidelity music playback.
